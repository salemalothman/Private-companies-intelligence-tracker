# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-02)

**Core value:** Every generated insight is grounded and honestly labelled — real facts vs. confidence-tagged estimates vs. transparent comps math — never fabricated financials or invented probabilities.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-02 — Roadmap created (4 phases, 18 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Hybrid speculation: qualitative forward-looking + confidence labels; no fabricated quantitative models.
- Distribute narrative into existing tabs (no Thesis tab) + one new Valuation Targets tab.
- One structured Grok agent → `company_analysis` JSONB, on demand (separate from Sync).
- Valuation Targets = comps model; comps inputs computed in code, growth proposed by agent, user overrides growth % + multiple percentile with live recompute.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phases 2, 3, 4 all depend on the Phase 1 substrate (`company_analysis` schema + `runDeepDive` output shape). The `sections`/`valuation` JSONB shapes must be settled in Phase 1 to avoid rework downstream.
- Guardrails are hard gates: no fabricated financials, no predictive probabilities; forward-looking content must carry basis + confidence; quantitative valuation only via transparent peer-multiple comps.
