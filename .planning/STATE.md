# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-02)

**Core value:** Every generated insight is grounded and honestly labelled — real facts vs. confidence-tagged estimates vs. transparent comps math — never fabricated financials or invented probabilities.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 01 (01-01, 01-02, 01-03 complete)
Last activity: 2026-07-02 -- Completed 01-03 (confidence chip + empty-state + staleness helper)

Progress: [████████░░] 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~8 min
- Total execution time: ~0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | ~16 min | ~8 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~5m), 01-02 (~11m)
- Trend: on track

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-foundation P03 | 10 | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Hybrid speculation: qualitative forward-looking + confidence labels; no fabricated quantitative models.
- Distribute narrative into existing tabs (no Thesis tab) + one new Valuation Targets tab.
- One structured Grok agent → `company_analysis` JSONB, on demand (separate from Sync).
- Valuation Targets = comps model; comps inputs computed in code, growth proposed by agent, user overrides growth % + multiple percentile with live recompute.
- [Phase ?]: Shared ConfidenceChip built on Badge (success=fact, muted=estimate) + 3-step confidence dot; server-safe via extracted pure mapping helpers
- [Phase ?]: isStale is a pure observational may-be-stale helper defaulting to not-stale on missing/unparseable inputs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phases 2, 3, 4 all depend on the Phase 1 substrate (`company_analysis` schema + `runDeepDive` output shape). The `sections`/`valuation` JSONB shapes must be settled in Phase 1 to avoid rework downstream.
- Guardrails are hard gates: no fabricated financials, no predictive probabilities; forward-looking content must carry basis + confidence; quantitative valuation only via transparent peer-multiple comps.
